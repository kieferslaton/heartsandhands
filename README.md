Attention!!!

In order to make this code work, you will need three secret keys:

For the calendar: a CALENDAR_ID and a CALENDAR_API
For the donations page: a STRIPE_API

You can create a file called apikeys.js in the src/ folder with the following code:

module.exports = {
    CALENDAR_ID: "Insert Calendar ID Here",
    CALENDAR_API: "Insert Calendar API Here", 
    STRIPE_API: "Insert Stripe API Here"
}
